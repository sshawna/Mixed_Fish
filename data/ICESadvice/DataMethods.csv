2015,"The projections made use of data requested as part of an ICES data call issued formally under the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF) regulations. This provides a much greater consistency between catch totals supplied to ICES. To allow consideration of fleets defined by length categories, separate data files containing total weight of landings and discards and effort in kW-days by fleet and métier were also requested. 
All analyses were conducted using the Fcube method (Ulrich et al., 2011).
","Total landings (2014) of all species considered in the mixed-fishery advice were 26 159 tonnes, with:</p>   ~86% landed by otter trawls and seines; </p>  ~ 3% landed by beam trawls; </p>  ~ 2% by gill-and trammelnets; and</p> 
</b>  ~ 9% by other gears . </p>  Total discards (not shown in the plot) were 7635 tonnes (23% by weight of total catch). Cod discards are not included  in the analysis.

2016,"Mixed-fisheries considerations are based on the single-stock assessments combined with knowledge on the species composition in catches in the Celtic Sea fisheries, using the Fcube method (Ulrich et al, 2011). Mixed-fisheries scenarios are based on central assumptions that fishing patterns and catchability in 2017 are the same as those in 2015. The same F assumption in 2016 is made as for the single-stock advice (status quo F, average 2013–2015). This mixed-fisheries forecast is limited to three gadoid stocks with full analytical single-species assessments, cod, haddock, and whiting . Forcasts are presented in terms of catch. Total catch is forecast based on current selection patterns observed in the fisheries (in 2015), except for cod where discards are uncertain and so only landings are presented. ","Total landings (2015) of all species considered in the mixed-fishery advice were 25 534 tonnes, with:</p>   ~85% landed by otter trawls and seines; </p>  ~ 3% landed by beam trawls; </p>  ~ 2% by gill-and trammelnets; and</p> 
</b>  ~ 10% by other gears . </p>  Total discards (not shown in the plot) were 12869 tonnes (34% by weight of total catch). Cod discards are not included  in the analysis.

2017,"Mixed-fisheries considerations are based on the single-stock assessments combined with knowledge on the species composition in catches in the Celtic Sea fisheries, using the Fcube method (Ulrich et al., 2011; 2017). Mixed-fisheries scenarios are based on central assumptions that fishing patterns and catchability in 2017 and 2018 are the same as those in 2016. This mixed-fisheries forecast is limited to three gadoid stocks with full analytical single-species assessments, cod, haddock, and whiting. Forcastss are presented in terms of catch. Total catch is forecast based on current selection patterns observed in the fisheries (in 2016), except for cod where discards are uncertain. For cod, following the single stock advice, an average discard rate of recent year (10.2%) is used to “top-up” the predicted landings to a predicated catch for each scenario. ","Total landings (2016) of all species considered in the mixed-fishery advice were 25 504 tonnes, with:</p>   ~88% landed by otter trawls and seines; </p>  ~ 2% landed by beam trawls; </p>  ~ 1% by gill-and trammelnets; and</p> 
</p>  ~ 9% by other gears . </p>  Total discards (not shown in the plot) were 18388 tonnes (42% by weight of total catch). Cod discards are not included  in the analysis ."
2018,"Mixed-fisheries considerations are based on the single-stock assessments combined with knowledge on the species composition in catches in the Celtic Sea fisheries, using the Fcube method (Ulrich et al., 2011, 2017). Mixed-fisheries scenarios are based on central assumptions that fishing patterns and catchability in 2018 and 2019 are the same as those in 2017. These mixed-fisheries forecasts are limited to three gadoid stocks with full analytical single-species assessments: cod, haddock, and whiting . Forecasts are presented in terms of catch, and are based on current selection patterns observed in the fisheries (average 2015–2017), except for cod where reliable discard information is only available for part of the time-series. For cod, following the single-stock advice, an average discard rate of recent years (7.73%) is used to ‘top-up’ the predicted landings to a predicted catch for each scenario","Total landings (2017) of all species considered in the mixed-fishery advice were 22 027 tonnes, with:</p> ~89% landed by otter trawls and seines;
</p> ~ 2% landed by beam trawls;
</p> ~ 1% by gill- and trammelnets; and
</p> ~ 8% by other gears.</p> Total discards (not shown in the plot) were 12 480 tonnes (36% by weight of total catch). Cod discards are not included in values, but landings in the analysis are raised by the average discard rate.

2019,"Mixed-fisheries considerations are based on the single-stock assessments combined with knowledge on the species composition in catches in the Celtic Sea fisheries, using the Fcube method (Ulrich et al., 2011, 2017). Mixed-fisheries scenarios are based on central assumptions that fishing patterns and catchability in 2019 and 2020 are the same as those in 2018.

These mixed-fisheries forecasts are limited to three gadoid stocks with full analytical single-species assessments: cod, haddock, and whiting . Forecasts are presented in terms of catch, and are based on current selection patterns observed in the fisheries (2018), except for cod where reliable discard information is only available for part of the time-series. For cod, following the single-stock advice, an average discard rate of recent years (7.6%) is used to ‘top-up’ the predicted landings to a predicted catch for each scenario. 

","Total landings (2018) of all species considered in the mixed-fishery advice were 15180 tonnes, with:</p> ~94% landed by otter trawls and seines;
